## To clone a zmays repository as apratice
git clone git@github.com:cecileane/zmays-snps.git ##to clone a repository
cd zmays-snps
git remote -v
## check the update on github; 
## and pull these changes from the shell
git branch -vv
git pull origin master 

git pull origin master
git log --graph

##Basic collaborative Workflow
git pull origin master #update your local repo 
git add #make your changes and stage them 
git commit #-m commit your changes
git push origin master #upload the changes to GitHub 

###
git commit -a -m # to add and commit your changes in one command


## Github for collaboration

##Remote commands
git remote -v #lists all the remotes that are configured ()
git remote add [name] [url] #is used to add a new remote
git remote remove [name] #removes a remote. Note that it doesnâ€™t affect the remote repository at all - it just removes the link to it from the local repo.
git remote set-url [name] [newurl] #changes the URL that is associated with the remote. 
#This is useful if it has moved, e.g. to a different GitHub account, or from GitHub to a different hosting service. Or, if we made a typo when adding it!
git remote rename [oldname] [newname] #changes the local alias by which a remote is known - its name. For example, one could use this to change upstream to fred.
